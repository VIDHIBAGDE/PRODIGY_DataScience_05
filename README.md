US Traffic Accident Analysis
This project analyzes traffic accident data from the United States to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle (link to dataset). The main objectives of this analysis are:
1) Identifying Accident Hotspots: Visualizing geographic areas with a high frequency of accidents.
2) Understanding Contributing Factors: Investigating how road conditions, weather, and time of day impact accident occurrence.
The findings from this analysis will provide insights that can be valuable for traffic management, infrastructure planning, and public safety measures.
